Computation time:
This program was tested on the 07 April 2025 on a computer with a armprocessor with a maximum clock frequency of 3504 MHz with 8 physical cores, 8 logical cores and 8.00GB of RAM, using the Operating System Darwin Darwin Kernel Version 23.1.0: Mon Oct  9 21:28:31 PDT 2023; root:xnu-10002.41.9~6/RELEASE_ARM64_T8112. With this hardware and software combination the response time (time taken from start to end of process) for this program took [insert time with units] to complete.
